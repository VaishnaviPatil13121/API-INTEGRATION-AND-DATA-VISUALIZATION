Project:API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION

Here's a comprehensive Python script for fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and creating a visualization dashboard using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Overview of the Script
1. Fetch Weather Data: Retrieves current weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for a user-specified city.
2. Data Visualization: Displays a bar chart summarizing key weather parameters and a pie chart to represent the contribution of various parameters.
3. Dashboard Output: Combines visualizations for a concise dashboard experience.

Below is the Python script:
Key Features:
1. Dual Visualization:
   - Bar Chart: Displays individual weather parameters.
   - Pie Chart: Shows the proportional contribution of parameters.
2. Dynamic City Input: Prompts for the city name at runtime.


The output visualization based on example weather data for "New York":
Bar Chart: Displays the values of temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Pie Chart: Illustrates the proportional contribution of these parameters
